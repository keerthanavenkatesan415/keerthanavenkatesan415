# 👋 Hi, I'm Keerthana Venkatesan!

🎓 **Computer Science and Data Science** major at Rutgers University (Class of 2027)  
🧠 Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellow | 📈 Aspiring Data Scientist 

I’m currently deepening my knowledge in data science and machine learning through the **Break Through Tech AI Program at Cornell Tech**, where I get to collaborate with peers and faculty on impactful projects. I'm also a strong advocate for diversity in tech and an active member of **Women in Computer Science** organization at my university's chapter.

Outside of class, I’ve worked on projects that combine clean design, technical depth, and data-driven insights. I'm always looking to learn, build, and contribute to meaningful solutions.

## 🎯 Featured Project: [Sentimentify](https://github.com/rithikapathuri/Sentimentify)  
Built during **HackHERS 2025**, Sentimentify is a multimodal web app that detects emotional tone and bias in both news articles and personal text messages.

**🔍 What It Does:**  
- Analyzes sentiment and bias in articles and text using a combination of **TextBlob**, **Google Gemini**, and **HuggingFace’s distilled BART**  
- Supports **text input and image OCR**, delivering scores for neutrality, subjectivity, approval, disapproval, and an overall bias score

**🔧 How It Works:**  
- Backend: Python, Flask, OCR, NLP APIs  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja with responsive UI  
- Deployed a working prototype that combines visual clarity with robust sentiment modeling

**🚀 Highlights:**  
- Integrates pre-trained NLP models for fast, meaningful results  
- Recognized for creating an accessible and insightful bias detection platform  
- See full project breakdown on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/sentimentify-oaprti)

## ✨ Fun Fact

You’ll usually find me sipping on a brown sugar matcha latte 🍵 while looking for new projects to apply my data analysis skills and curiosities by diving into data visualizations. When I need to recharge? A good k-drama, anime, sitcom or walk in the sunset cheers me right up!
